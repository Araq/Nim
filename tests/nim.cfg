--path:"../testament/lib" # so we can `import stdtest/foo` in this dir

#--noNimblePath
  # avoids bugs where files from another Nim repo are unintendedly used
  # in case user has ~/.nimble/pkgs/compiler-\#head/ pointing to another repo.
  # would need to make this work with tests that require nimble packages, eg:
  # tests/cpp/tasync_cpp.nim requires `jester`.


#--path:".."
  # pros: allow `import compiler/foo` instead
  # of `import "../.." / compiler/foo`, and allow using relative instead of
  # absolute paths, for example in megatest.nim
  # cons: puts every path in scope, including ones unintended for in tests.
