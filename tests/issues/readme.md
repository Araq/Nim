This directory can be used for adding a test case to a github issue, eg:
issue `#7976` would have test case named `t7976.nim`
It makes it easier to find which issue corresponds to a test caes, or vice
versa, and removes the guesswork of trying to figure out an appropriate
directory/filename by being more systematic.
