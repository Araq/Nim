Tips for making a perfect PR (remove this message before submitting):

* See [guidelines for contributing](https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/contributing.html)
* If needed, update changelog.md (e.g. for breaking change, addition, or other significant change)
* Add '[ci-skip]' in commit msg to skip CI for commits that shouldn't require CI to run (in particular minor documentation changes like typo fixes)
* Add 'refs #bugid' or 'fixes #bugid' to either reference or fix issues respectively one your PR is merged
