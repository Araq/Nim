## v0.20.0 - XX/XX/2018

### Changes affecting backwards compatibility

- The ``isLower``, ``isUpper`` family of procs in strutils/unicode
  operating on **strings** have been
  deprecated since it was unclear what these do. Note that the much more
  useful procs that operator on ``char`` or ``Rune`` are not affected.

- `strutils.editDistance` has been deprecated,
  use `editdistance.editDistance` or `editdistance.editDistanceAscii`
  instead.

- The OpenMP parallel iterator \``||`\` now supports any `#pragma omp directives`
  and not just `#pragma omp parallel for`. See [OpenMP documentation](https://www.openmp.org/wp-content/uploads/OpenMP-4.5-1115-CPP-web.pdf).

  The default annotation is `parallel for`, if you used OpenMP without annotation
  the change is transparent, if you used annotations you will have to prefix
  your previous annotations with `parallel for`.
