Deprecated, unused and unmaintained files can be moved here when they have some value,
e.g. if someone want to revive them in their project or in this repo. If a deprecated and unused file
is redundant, it should just be removed instead.

See also https://github.com/nim-lang/graveyard, which is maintained on a best effort basis
and has different goals.
