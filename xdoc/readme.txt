Nim's Code Examples
===================

This folder contains rst files documenting some worked examples. 
The documentation is written in a format called *reStructuredText*, 
a markup language that reads like ASCII and can be converted to 
HTML automatically!

The rst files contain code examples that showcase particular concepts
or topics, but may be used as documentation examples by multiple 
library modules.
